         that is important to me.  Let's start with what I am doing in <br>
        class. I am taking this LaunchCode class to launch my career in the <br>

      <p>One thing that I love is problem solving.  I'm very analytical and <br>
      persistent.  I love 'haha' moments. I love the challenge of figuring out <br>
      how something works. Hence, that is why I am launching my career in Information Technology to be able to do 
    some of the things I enjoy most, like travelling.</p>
    <h3>Food</h3>

      <p>Don't get me started with my favorite foods.  I love healthy food<br>
      I like all kinds of berries: strawberries, blackberries, raspberries, etc.
      I like romaine lettuce, green juices, pecans, walnuts, pumpkins seed and mangoes.<br>
      Some of my favorite tropical fruits are lychees, rambutans, logans, mangoes, and papayas.
      No diet is complete without greens. For the greens department, I like spinach, kale, <br>
      Jamaican Callaloo.</p>
